This is a short set of homework for using the `dplyr` library.  It is going to use the `flight` data, we played with in the lecture content.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)
```

1. What is the average delay for each month during 2013 of flights from?  Make the ouptut into a nicely formated table and use month names.

2. Which day of the week are you more likely to *arrive on time* to Phoenix Arizona?  Make the output into a bar plot.

3. Which airlines have, on average, arrival times that are earlier than scheduled?

4. What are the five airports that have the shortest flight times?  Give the results as a table.

5. Is there a correlation between flight distance and total delay?  Use the function `cor.test( X, Y )`.  Interpret the output.
