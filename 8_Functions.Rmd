In `R`, functions are a way for us to *encapsulate* chuncks of data.  Functions are generally written to help out with common tasks.  If you find yourself rewriting a bit of code, you should consider putting it into a function.  What the do is dependent upon you.  You can have functions that:

1. Take no data and only do something if necessary (e.g., check that some instrument is working and if not, give me a text message).
1. Take no data and do some task returning you the result (e.g., go grab these data and format it ).  
1. Take some data and return you a result (e.g., validate or translate these data ).  
1. Take some data and return you nothing (e.g., take these data and make my way cool plot).  
1. It would be odd to have a function that takes no data and does nothing unless you were writing code whose sole purpose is to waste computer resources (a virus perhaps...).

In general, making functions allow us to make type less often (and make fewer mistakes) and generally helps us be more productive.  It is only a short step from making a few functions to creating your own package that has a suite of functions that help you do your own work most efficiently.

## Case Study - Dates

Let's take an example of some code that we've been running over and over again, turning columns of `month`, `day`, and `year` into a date object as an example.  To do this we must do the following:  
 
 1. Take the columns of data and paste them together to make a new column that has the 'character representation' of the date object.  
 2. Load in the library `lubridate` to get the appropriate functions.  
 3. Set up a `orders` string to let the `parse_data_time()` function know how the data are in the string.  
 4. Convert the column into a real date object.

Let's us the New York city Flight Data from 2013 as an example.

```{r}
library( nycflights13)
data(flights)
summary(flights)
```
 
The code for translating this is as follows.  First, we make a string representation (I'll use the slash '/' to separate entities).

```{r}
DateString <- paste( flights$month,
                     flights$day,
                     flights$year, sep="/")
head(DateString)
```

Then we define the way we ordered the date entries using the appropriate `%x` representations for month, day, and four digit year.

```{r}
orders <- "%m/%d/%Y"
```

Load in the library

```{r}
library( lubridate )
```

Then convert it.

```{r}
Date <- parse_date_time( DateString, orders = orders )
summary( Date )
```

To put it all together into a single function we must *wrap* it within a chunk of code and make a name for it.  The general format for this is:

```
myCollFunctionName <- function( Argument1, Argument2, ..., ArgumentN  ) {

  # all your code goes here.

}
```

So in our case, we could do the following:

```{r}
makeMyDate <- function( month, day, year ) {
  
  library( lubridate )  # I like to put all my libraries at the top
  
  DateString <- paste( month,
                       day,
                       year,
                       sep= "/")
  orders <- "%m/%d/%Y"
  
  Date <- parse_date_time( DateString, 
                           orders = orders )
  
  # It is important to have this return() function.  This passes the Date object
  #  back from the function to the code that called the function.  
  return( Date )
}
```

Once you have `sourced` that code, you can call it as:

```{r}
dates <- makeMyDate( flights$month, flights$day, flights$year )
summary( dates )
```

## Map, Reduce, & Filter

Functions are quite handy to use in your every day programming.  Let's consider a simple case, where I have a function that does a single operation on some data.  Let's say it squares the data we give to it.

```{r}
f <- function( x ) {
  return( x^2 )
}
```

We can call this function with a single data type as:

```{r}
f( 2 )
```

Or with a bunch of data, say

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,5,4 )
f(x)
```

### Maps

Essentially, we are passing a vector of data to a function that is iterating over all of it and doing some operation.  This 

![Map Function Schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS543/master/Content/Map.png)

Another way of thinking about this, and one that may be more helpful is that we are *Map*ping the function `f()` to each element of the vector as depicted below.  

![Map function schematic as vector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS543/master/Content/Map2.png)

This way of thinking about the data is a bit different but defines what is called *Functional Programming*, a kind of programming where we focus on developing and deploying functions *onto* data instead of sending data *into* functions.  This is a very nice way of thinking about it.  In R, we can do this as:


```{r}
Map( f, x  )
```

This returns a `list` of responses.  To get it to give a vector we can:

```{r}
unlist( Map( f, x )  )
```

We will come back to lists in a week or so.

### Filters

Another operation we may do like this is to filter data.  Here we define a function that returns `TRUE` and `FALSE` values for a vector indicating the value passed is even (`TRUE` because the modulus operator returns the 'remainder' of division) or odd (when value / 2 has remainder != 0).

```{r}
g <- function(x) {
  return( x %% 2 == 0 )
}
```


Which looks like: 

![Filter even data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS543/master/Content/Filter.png)

And when we apply it to some data, we get:

```{r}
g(2)
```

for even and for odd values we get:

```{r}
g(3)
```

We can `Filter()` vectors of data based upon this function as:

```{r}
Filter( g, x )
```


In normal, `R` we could do this using the `g()` function to generate `TRUE` and `FALSE` indices based upon the values in `x` and then pass them to `x` using the square brackets.  

```{r}
x[ g(x) ]
```

It does the same thing but is *much less clear* what is going on here.  The `Filter()` is blantantly saying, 

> HELLO, I'm filtering over here!


### Reduce

To round this out, we also have a `Reduce()` function that combines data using some operation.  This can be a simple operation like `+` which means Add them all together, or something more involved that is defined as a larger function.  

Let's start easy.  The following code sasy, *take all the values in `x` and add them together*.

```{r}
Reduce( '+', x )
```

We can also multiply them.

```{r}
Reduce( '*', x )
```

Or we can define a function.  Here we need to give the function two arguments because the function is *walking down the vector, keeping and accumulating information as it goes along* so we need the value for the previous state as well as for the thing we do with the next one.  

As an example, here is a function that adds the square of the values together.

```{r}
h <- function( prev, new ) { 
  return( new*new + prev )
}

Reduce( h, x )
```


We can even tell `Reduce()` to start with some value other than 0.

```{r}
Reduce( h, x, init = 200)
```
